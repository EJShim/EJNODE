vtkPointSet is an abstract class that specifies the interface for
datasets that explicitly use "point" arrays to represent geometry.
For example, vtkPolyData and vtkUnstructuredGrid require point arrays
to specify point position, while vtkStructuredPoints generates point
positions implicitly.

## newInstance()

Construct a new vtkPointSet with some initial content.
